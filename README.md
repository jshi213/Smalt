# Smalt Starfish Group 38 - SE750/CS732 Project

# Documentation

Welcome to Smalt - A Spotify Music Alternative Listening Technology.

## Overview
Smalt is essentially a Web Application utilising the Spotify API to create playlists established by hosts and for guests to contribute towards the playlist created. Songs added to the playlist by the Guests of the party, will be queued based on the number of likes each song receives i.e. the songs at the top of the playlist would have received the highest number of likes. 

## Features
* Multiple 'rooms' can be created to host multiple parties.
* Screen resolution - scales to size regardless of device whether it be a Smart Phone or Tablet.  
* Voting - Guest can 'Like' a song based on their personal preferences.
* Hosts don't need to manually queue songs based on guests preferences - Smalt takes care of this. 
* Guests can request the same song to be played multiple times.
